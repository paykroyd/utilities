This repository is a place to hold common utility function across
all of the projects that I work on and just things that are nice to
have available in an ipython prompt.

Fascinated by Joe Armstrong's idea of keeping all of the functions in one
package with metadata to find them rather then relying on package names, etc
to organize them I'm going to start that way. Although, I can see myself
reverting to a more normal layout pretty quickly since I don't have any
fancy metadata to use for searching. But we'll see.

I'm starting to back away a bit from the idea of just one file. This now has 3 files, but it should probably have more than that. I sort of just makes sense to break things up by namespace in the file not just with the function name.
